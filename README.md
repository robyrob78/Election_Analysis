## Election-Audit Summary:
The script written for this campaign did exactly what it was supposed to and returned all the results we were looking for. However, this script could be modified to work beyond just this single election. Something else we might be interested in would be number of registered voters per county vs. the number of votes cast per county to give us a an active voter percentage per county. This might look like this:

votes = county_votes.get(county_name)

active_voter_percentage = float(votes) / float(county_voters) * 100

Something else we could change based on what level the election is would be the variables. If this were a mayoral election, we could change the "county" variables to "district". We could also add other variables like candidates or different districts with the append. function.
